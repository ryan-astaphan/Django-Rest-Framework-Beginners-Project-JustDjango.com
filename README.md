# Django Rest Framework
## A Beginner's Project

In this project I made my first ever API. The API was then connected to a basic JavaScript frontend.

Topics covered in this project:
* Serializers
  * serialization and JSON parsing
* Request methods
  * POST, GET, PUT, DELETE
* Function-based API views
* Class-based API views
  * APIView and decorator
  * Mixins
  * Generics
* Permission classes- Hyperlinking between related models
* Routers and Viewsets


### *Note:* In this project I followed a premium tutorial from [JustDjango.com](https://learn.justdjango.com/roadmaps/django-basic)
